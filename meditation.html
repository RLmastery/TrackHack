    Method 1: Visualization	
    
    <p>
	Bring to mind the success you would like to create. Imagine what your life would be like if you achieved this success. Truly visualize precisely how you would think and feel if you were successful. 
  


    </p>
	
    <p>
        Your mind will create obstacles. You will become aware of the things that are preventing you from being successful. This is important because you need to acknowledge those obstacles to overcome them. When your mind produces an obstacle, acknowledge it. Say, “Yes, this is an obstacle on my way to success.” Then say, “This is how I will overcome this obstacle.” Then visualize overcoming the obstacle and moving towards success. 
        
    </p>
	
    <p>
        Continue this process of visualizing success while acknowledging challenges for twenty minutes.

    <h3> AirBNB Case Study </h3>
    <p>
        How renters made from landlords without owning

        Many areas of the country, Airbnb a property can be a very lucrative business to have if your place is in a spot people want to vist. 
        Tourism and traveling in the United States can bring people to want to rent places convenient and that provide a nice scenery. 
        This led to the few who found an advantage that if they rented a long term lease at a place they could objectively rent out their place for the weekend to Airbnb enjoyers for a premium so long as local regulation allowed. 
        First adopters of this made thousands for simply being a broker of owner to airbnb hosting. 

        Taking a look at the case lets do a number breakdown of how this individual came to be. 
        Let's say for imagine at the time the First person ever did this there were approximately only 100,000 people who could rent a property and were aware of Airbnb. 
        Out of those 100,000 indiduals, how many do you think ever thought even remotely could've thought of an idea like this. I'd say majority wouldn't as most are caught up with their normal lives and don't quite ponder about these things outside the realm. 
        I'd say only of those 100,000 only about 1,000 may have had the idea of renting out their apartment to airbnb. 
        Of those lets say 1,000 how many do you think would have seriously considered executing this plan. How many of them do you think brushed the idea off? How many do you think rejected the idea and thought no way this could work?
        Many many people are always shutting down thoughts and ideas the brain doesnt align with. It's scary when a new idea outside of what is conventional or taught enters. The most often reaction is to push it away and let it fade into the abyss of forgotten. 
        10 left. Only 10 are going for the dream. 10 who will try this out, most who have never tried something of the alike. Out of those ten only about 1 of these individuals will be able to execute this at a high level. 
        1 who has executed this. Made money from this. Has made the unthought of to most, into something thats now a choice. 

        When we look at this, what made this 1 person different from the rest?
        Only 1 out of 10 who put this plan into action were able to execute on this idea at a high enough level to succeed. 
        10 out of the 1000 people overcame their instinct of fear and judgement to do something unordinary away from their normal comfort. 
        1000 out of the 100,000 had their eyes open enough to where they saw the crack, they could see through to the shimmer on the other side of this chance. 

        Execution can help you be the 1 in 10. 
        Overcoming Fear and Judgement can help you be the 10 in 1000. 
        Open-mindedness and Creativity can help you be the 1000 in 100000. 

        Theres a reason why the winners keep on hitting the ball. They figured it out, and its easy for them now.
